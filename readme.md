# Identify and Rank Texas Hold'em Poker Hands
GOOD NIGHT
# CHANGES
# CHANGE2


Hello there! I’m glad you could join us. Although I’m not sure who you are, you’re presumably here
because you heard about the quantum supremacy experiment recently published by a collaboration
from Google, NASA Ames, UC Santa Barbara, and a host of other teams from around the world
[12]. You may have seen the articles declaring a “quantum supremacy breakthrough,” and had
some sense that something momentous had occurred. We’ve finally produced a quantum computer
that can outperform a classical computer! In fact, “outperform” is a bit of a misnomer here; since
the task completed by the quantum computer would take a state-of-the-art supercomputer about
10,000 years, it’s more accurate to say that a classical computer could never effectively match the
quantum compute

This program reads the community cards and each player's hand. Then, the program identifies each hand and rank them according to the Texas Hold'em rules.

## How to run

This program accepts data with two different methods. Because of that, it has two main (main.py and main_txt.py).
If you have text file use main_txt.py, otherwise main.py

If you enter a different format or duplicate a card, you will receive an error message.

### main_txt.py

This file reads a text file that  contains community and hand cards. The first line will contain the five community cards. Each line after that will have a player's name followed by their two cards.


First, you should create a text file with the following format:

```
KS AD 3H 7C TD
John 9H 7S
Sam AC KH
Becky JD QC
```
Then, put the file in the root of the project. After that run the program with this command:

```
python main_txt.py
```

It will ask you to enter the file name, press enter. 
After that the result will be shown as:

```
1 Becky Straight Ace
2 Sam Two Pair Ace King
3 John Pair 7
```
### main.py 

When you run this file, it will ask you to enter community cards and after that player's hands.

Run the program with this command:

```
python main.py
```
Then, it asks to enter community cards and after that player's hands.

Format of community cards:

```
KS AD 3H 7C TD
```
Format of player's hand:

```
John 9H 7S
```

As soon as you enter the first hand, you will be able to press "s" to stop the program and see the rank and evaluation.

### Prerequisites

To run this program you need Python 3.9
